                <h1>Hi, This is not about me, its about her.</h1>
                <p>Despite her looks, Ina'nis is actually a priestess of the Ancient Ones. One day, she picked up a strange book and then 
                    started to gain the power of controlling tentacles. To her, tentacles are just a part in her ordinary life; it has never been 
                    a big deal for her. However, her girly mind does want to get them dressed up and stay pretty.
                    After gaining power, she started hearing Ancient Whispers and Revelations. Hence, she began her VTuber activities to 
                    deliver random sanity checks on humanity, as an ordinary girl.</p>

                <p> Ina is a gentle, peaceful, soft-spoken and down-to-earth girl with an easy-going temperament, so much so that she 
                    reverses stress and insanity in her viewers rather than encouraging it, despite her Lovecraftian role as "the maiden who 
                    speaks for the old gods." She is very loving and aware towards her fellow members, capable of talking extensively about 
                    each one and their respective quirks.</p>    

                <p>Ina is very engaged in popular culture with massively diverse tastes, enjoying a large variety of genres in an equally large 
                    pool of mediums, whether it be mecha anime, pop rock, fps, only to name a few. A notable feature of Ina is her significant 
                    artistic talent, illustrating multiple promotional content for HoloEN as well as the majority of assets she uses for her 
                    VTuber activities.</p>
